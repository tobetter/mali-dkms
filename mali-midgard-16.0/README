This repository contains the out-of-tree Linux kernel driver for the ARM Mali
Midgard GPU.  It is based on the r16p0 release, called 16.0 in the Debian DKMS
packages.  It also contains some patches to make it work with mainline device
tree bindings backported to v4.9 kernel.  Newer kernel versions are not
supported in this driver version.

To use it with dkms, first clone this repository in /usr/src:

  sudo clone https://git.collabora.com/git/user/gtucker/mali-midgard.git /usr/src/mali-midgard-16.0

Then add it to dkms (will end up in /var/lib/dkms)

  sudo dkms add -m mali-midgard -v 16.0

Now you can decide to just build it to use it straight away:

  sudo dkms build -m mali-midgard -v 16.0

Or, make a Debian dkms source package:

  sudo dkms mkdeb -m mali-midgard -v 16.0 --source-only
