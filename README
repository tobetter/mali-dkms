This repository contains the out-of-tree Linux kernel driver for the ARM Mali
Midgard GPU.  It is based on the r16p0 release, called 16.0 in this Debian DKMS
package.  It also contains some patches to make it work with mainline device
tree bindings backported to v4.9 kernel.  Newer kernel versions are not
supported in this driver version.

Tested on Firefly rk3288 board with Debian Jessie and Stretch using kernel
package linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp_4.9.30-2+deb9u3_armhf.deb from Stretch and
its backport to Jessie.
