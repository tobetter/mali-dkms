This repository contains the out-of-tree Linux kernel driver for the
ARM Mali Midgard GPU (T60x, T62x, T76x).  It is based on the r16p0
release, called 16.0 in this Debian DKMS package.  It also contains
some patches to make it work with mainline device tree bindings
backported to v4.9 and 4.14 kernels.

Tested on Firefly rk3288 board with Debian Jessie and Stretch using kernel
package linux-image-4.9.0-3-armmp_4.9.30-2+deb9u3_armhf.deb from Stretch and
its backport to Jessie.
